# ATA
The purpose of this repo is to share ideas and examples to other Associates in the ATA Study Squad. 
This is not meant to substitute any work or studying that needs to be done. 
There are many solutions to these problems, these are just some of the possible solutions/ideas. 

Apologies for the naming scheme and examples being out of order. 

CSS has been integrated into the html code for purpose of being able to view on browser. 
Seperate CSS files will be uploaded as well.
